<h1>The Corporate UI Starter Kit</h1>
<p>Developing a solution split into Web Components rather than one big hunch of code slightly differs from traditional development. In this folder we'll some files that will help you understand both how to use web components in the Corporate UI and also how to develop your own.</p>
<p>Usually, we want to keep documentation to a minimal and keep the files well commented. If you'll open index.html in this folder, you'll have the chance to learn a lot about what the different components and file inclusions will do for you. The files in this folder are write protected so please make a copy of the folder and move it outside your GitHub clone.</p>
