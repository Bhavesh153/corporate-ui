# Corporate UI - UX Library

In this project you will find components and design patterns for both corporate level as well as brand level.
We might add project level as well if that seems to be needed.

The main goal of this library is to present currently available components as well as design patterns and how to use them.

If you have any questions please dont hesitate to contact us on Slack, Lync, by email or by making a request in our github page.
