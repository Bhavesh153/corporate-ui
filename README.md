#Corporate-UI
##Welcome to the Coroporate UI repository 
Feel free to pull the Corporate UI (Scania Bootstrap) and use it in your project. For best performance you should create a pull request and then a new version of Scania Bootstrap will be created and distributed to 30 servers around the globe.
DO NOT include Scania Bootstrap in your own build. Include it from our CDN service, more information available in the [release notes] (https://github.scania.com/Corporate-UX/corporate-ui/releases).
