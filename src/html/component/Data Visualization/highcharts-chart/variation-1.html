### Variation-1

Spline charts integrate all the characteristics of a conventional line chart except for the fact that unlike line charts, which connect data points with straight lines, spline charts draw a fitted curved line to join the data points.

Spline charts can be used for plotting data that requires the usage of curve-fitting e.g. an impulse-response chart, a product life cycle chart, etc. It is also significantly used in designing Pareto charts.

<demo>
    <highcharts-chart type="spline" data='[[0,0],[1,7],[2,1],[3,6],[4,8],[5,6]]' title='Lowered fuel consumption during one week' x-zoom x-label="Iterations" y-label="Awesomeness Index">
    </highcharts-chart>
